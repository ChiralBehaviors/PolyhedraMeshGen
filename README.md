# PolyhedraMeshGen

PolyhedraMeshGen is a small Java 8+ application containing code for generating polyhedra meshes. The main focus will be on convex polyhedra with certain degrees of symmetry, but this could change in the future. In addition to basic polyhedra such as the Platonic and Archimedean solids, I plan to support the generation of related meshes such as prisms, antiprisms, and approximate spheres.
